# Operation Earthquake

This is my entry for the [LÖVE JAM 2022](https://itch.io/jam/love2d-jam-2022).  
This is my first ever full project released using this wonderful framework.

All the sprites, sounds effect and music were made during the game jam.  
The font is made by [Zeh Fernando](https://www.dafont.com/fr/perfect-dos-vga-437.font?text=retry&back=bitmap).
